# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect outerHTML Usage

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the incorrect usage of `outerHTML` in HTML.  The bug arises from trying to completely replace a parent element (div) using its `outerHTML` property instead of its `innerHTML`.  This will remove the entire element and cause unexpected behavior.

The solution provides the correct approach using `innerHTML` or a more robust method involving replacing the element's contents with a clone of the new element.

## Bug
The `bug.html` file demonstrates the problem. The code attempts to replace the entire div element with a paragraph element, effectively removing the div from the DOM entirely.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file presents the corrected code.
